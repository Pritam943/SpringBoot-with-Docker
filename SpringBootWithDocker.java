SpringBoot-with-Docker

Create image of the SpringBoot application in Docker

Once you have chosen a build system, you donâ€™t need the ARG. You can hard code the JAR location. For Maven, that would be as follows:
Dockerfile
COPYFROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-alpine
VOLUME /tmp
  target/*.jar app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/app.jar"]

  
Then we can build an image with the following command:
docker build -t myorg/myapp .

  
Then we can run it by running the following command:
docker run -p 8080:8080 myorg/myapp
  
The output resembles the following sample output:
COPY.   ____          _            __ _ _
/\\ / ___'_ __ _ _(_)_ __  __ _ \ \ \ \
( ( )\___ | '_ | '_| | '_ \/ _` | \ \ \ \
